## Prompts used to make the code

I'd like a downloadable text file to use in testing. There should be 100 lines. Each line should consist of a random number of random string fragments separated by a tab. There should be between 0 and 12 columns of tab-delimited text per line.

Here is the content of the generated text file with 100 lines of tab-delimited random string fragments (0 to 12 columns per line). You can copy and paste it into a new file (e.g., save as test.txt) using a text editor for your testing purposes.

That's good, but can you make each fragment an English sentence fragment? It'd make for better debugging

Here is the updated content of the generated text file with 100 lines of tab-delimited random English sentence fragments (0 to 12 columns per line). You can copy and paste it into a new file (e.g., save as test.txt) using a text editor for your testing purposes.

Now I'd like an F# executable script that takes this input from the console and makes a jagged array of strings

I'd like this to fail safely if there's no data in the test file or if the test file doesn't exist. In either case, print a descriptive error message and return back to the OS

The EntryPoint attribute at line 4 does not work under git bash

Ok, can you make this where it's also callable from an external function, so that it runs either from the command line or inside a larger monolith

Could you make the tab delimiter a hard-coded variable set at the top and add a pure function at the bottom that does the reverse, that is, taks a jagged string array and sends it to stdout? Also, will this code take piped code? Ideally I'd rather pipe things in and out of this rather than pass a file name
