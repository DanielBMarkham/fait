## Prompts used to make the code

I'd like a downloadable text file to use in testing. There should be 100 lines. Each line should consist of a random number of random string fragments separated by a tab. There should be between 0 and 12 columns of tab-delimited text per line.

Here is the content of the generated text file with 100 lines of tab-delimited random string fragments (0 to 12 columns per line). You can copy and paste it into a new file (e.g., save as test.txt) using a text editor for your testing purposes.

That's good, but can you make each fragment an English sentence fragment? It'd make for better debugging

Now I'd like an F# executable script that takes this input from the console and makes a jagged array of strings

I'd like this to fail safely if there's no data in the test file or if the test file doesn't exist. In either case, print a descriptive error message and return back to the OS

The EntryPoint attribute at line 4 does not work under git bash

Ok, can you make this where it's also callable from an external function, so that it runs either from the command line or inside a larger monolith

Could you make the tab delimiter a hard-coded variable set at the top and add a pure function at the bottom that does the reverse, that is, taks a jagged string array and sends it to stdout? Also, will this code take piped code? Ideally I'd rather pipe things in and out of this rather than pass a file name

ARCHITECTURE IS A MESS - RESET

I would like an F# script, executable from either the windows or bash command line, that accepts piped text input from stdin and outputs piped text to stdout unless given an option for an input filename or an output filename, in which case it uses that. I would ike this script to never fail, instead writing whatever error occurred to the sterror pipe. It should only be pure functions. A seoncd F# script should be the test for this one. It should be constructed similarly and call the first one. The text file each script should work on is tab-delimited  and coulds contain any number of lines of text, so streams should be used instead of complete data loads. Finally, each of these scripts should be written in a pure functional manner and the function that does the data processing should be separate from the main function that is called from the outside world, allowing it to be used in other programs wihtout the corresponding framework code.

  Analyzing script requirements

  The script needs to handle piped text input from stdin and output to stdout.

  It should accept options for input/output filenames if provided.

  Processing tab-delimited text is mentioned, but no specific operation is detailed.

  Both scripts must be pure functional, with processing separate from the main function for reusability.

  The main script will use System.Environment.GetCommandLineArgs() for argument parsing to keep it simple and pure.

  Planning stream handling

  Streams will read lines lazily using TextReader for input.

  Let's consider using fsi.CommandLineArgs for parsing script arguments in F# interactive.

  On input file errors, the script writes to stderr and falls back to stdin.

  For file input, the script must dispose resources properly.

  Output handling mirrors input, using TextWriter for stdout or files, with similar error fallback.

  Designing test script

  The test script calls the main script using System.Diagnostics.Process.

  It needs to test tab-delimited processing, possibly by checking field reversal.

  The test should create a temp input file with tab-delimited lines to verify processing.

  The test script's processing logic should be pure and return test messages as a sequence.

  Temp files can be created using Path.GetTempFileName() in F# for testing purposes.

  Running the process involves IO, which isn't pure, but the user likely means the processing part is pure.

  Implementing test execution

  The test script can use ProcessStartInfo to run the main script with arguments.

  Tests include piping input and checking output, expecting reversed tab-delimited fields.

(putting this into part2.fsx)

(think think think code)

(I run a simple test)

Let's call these two scripts part2.fsx and part2-test.fsx The first script seems to work from bash, but the compiler is giving a warn about the type or namespace fsi is not defined. When calling from DOS, however, the command cat test.txt | part2.fsx generates no output at all. It was supposed to pipe all input and output using the stdin and stout features or their equivalents in the OS being used and use fsi or whatever the equivalents are to find the command line arguments.

  Investigating script issues

  The script part2.fsx works in bash but shows a warning about undefined type or namespace fsi.

  In F#, fsi.CommandLineArgs is used for command line args, but fsi might not be recognized outside interactive mode.

  To make it executable on both Windows and Unix, let's consider using dotnet fsi explicitly for cross-platform compatibility.

  For cross-platform, System.Environment.GetCommandLineArgs() can work, skipping the first few elements like "dotnet" and "fsi".

  On Windows, the script generates no output with "cat test.txt | part2.fsx" since cat isn't available; use "type test.txt | dotnet fsi part2.fsx" instead.

  Exploring fsi warning solutions

  The warning suggests fsi isn't defined, possibly when not run with dotnet fsi.

  Let's search for ways to get command line args in F# scripts across platforms.

  A standard approach is to find the script name in the args and take the rest as user arguments.

  To fix, we'll update both scripts to use a method that skips to the script name and takes the tail, avoiding fsi references.

  Currently looking for more info on handling command line args in F# scripts to confirm the approach.

(seems to work the same under bash. no compiler warnings now, but stil no output under dos)



I'm still smoke testing the first one. This seems to work the same under bash. no compiler warnings now, but still no output under dos, Can't dos use pipes to both input and output data from the console?

Thought for one minute 36 seconds

On Windows Command Prompt (DOS), yes, you can absolutely use pipes for input and output with the scriptâ€”just like in bash. The issue is that Windows doesn't natively recognize the shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env -S dotnet fsi) to make the .fsx file directly executable. Instead, you need to explicitly invoke the F# interactive runtime with dotnet fsi as a prefix.To pipe input from a file and get output to the console, use this command (replacing cat with the native type equivalent):

I like that. I made that file. Running both scripts, part2.fsx and part2-test.fsx, seems to work under default conditions. I also made a part2-test.cmd dos file so that both scripts are used the same. The test script, however, seems to think that the incoming streaming file is the test. It should not be. Instead it should be the output from some previous version of the main code, ie jagged string arrays. The test file should have a section for hard coded tests, perhaps six of them, that default to all passing. In addition, it should take a file that describes the tests to be ran, in the same jagged string format, as an optional input. No input provided, it just runs the hard-coded tests. Both scripts should have standard comman line help options which explain both the purpose, name, and parameters available to the script. In addition, examples should be provided for both help files.

Evaluating script functionality

Running part2.fsx and part2-test.fsx works fine under default conditions.

The test script mistakenly treats the incoming streaming file as the test.

Let's search for ways to adjust the test script to test the processor instead.

The test script should call the processor and capture its output and errors.
