Functional programming AI Test

The goal is to start with stdin and a tab-delimited input file. Begin with any input allowed and end with a strongly-typed array (or at least as strongly-typed as is possible with random strings)

The code should be Pure Functional, i.e. able to run in a browser, a monolith, or from the command-line. This first step is the command-line part of things.

***In other words, the goal of this project is to do nothing, nothing at all. I just want a function that can be called from the command line in both windows and bash. I want it to work just like the built-in commands, eg dir or cat. That's it. This means that whatever I'm doing here is by definition horsing around with the tools and environment and not getting anything done. Should be pretty quick, right? Right?***
