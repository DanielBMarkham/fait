Functional programming AI Test

The goal is to start with stdin and a tab-delimited input file. Begin with any input allowed and end with a strongly-typed array (or at least as strongly-typed as is possible with random strings)

The code should be Pure Functional, i.e. able to run in a browser, a monolith, or from the command-line. This first step is the command-line part of things.
